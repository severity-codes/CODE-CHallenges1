// You can define the functions bitwiseAND, bitwiseOR, and bitwiseXOR in JavaScript using the bitwise operators &, |, and ^ respectively.These operators perform the operations bit - by - bit on the binary representations of the numbers.
// these functions take two numbers, n1 and n2, as inputs and return the result of the bitwise operation between them. Hereâ€™s how each function works:

// bitwiseAND(n1, n2) will perform the AND operation. It returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are 1.
// bitwiseOR(n1, n2) will perform the OR operation. It returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bit of either operand (or both) is 1.
// bitwiseXOR(n1, n2) will perform the XOR operation. It returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of the operands are different.
// You can test these functions with any pair of integers to see how they compute the bitwise operations:

//Return the Sum of Two Numbers
function addition(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(addition(8, 1));

//Buggy Code (Part 1)

}
